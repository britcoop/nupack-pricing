##Exercise Reflection

I enjoyed doing this exercise. I chose to complete the task using client-side JavaScript, however I'd love to redo the
exercise in Ruby as this would be a valuable learning opportunity to satisfy my curiosity about Ruby. Additionally, had I
chosen a server side language for this task, the user could've tested different values directly from the command line. 
Although I did some Java programming while in school, most of my professional experience is with client-side languages. I'm
very much looking forward to expanding my knowledge about server-side programming. I plan to do this on my own but also hope
for this opportunity in my next position.
