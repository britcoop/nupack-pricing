I enjoyed doing this exercise. I chose to use JavaScript mostly because I'm the most familiar with JS. I'd love to redo the
exercise in Ruby as this would be a valuable learning opportunity as I have quite an interest in learning Ruby. I did Java
programming in school, however most of my professional experience is with client-side languages so Ruby would be of particular
value to me!
